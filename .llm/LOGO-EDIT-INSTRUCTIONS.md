## MAIN PROMPT - Create from Scratch

```
Create a professional medical logo for an OB-GYN practice:

DESIGN CONCEPT:
A stylized tree with a human figure incorporated into the trunk. The tree represents growth, life, family, and generations of care. The figure represents the nurturing care of women's health - arms reaching upward forming branches.

TREE DESIGN:
- Abstract human figure as the trunk/base - tan/beige colored (#C4A882)
- The figure has arms reaching upward that transition into branches
- Leaves arranged in a semi-circular canopy above the figure
- Leaves should be teardrop/petal shaped, scattered organically
- Mix of pink (#E8A0B5, #F5D0DC) and purple/mauve (#9B7BB8, #D4B8D5) colored leaves
- Approximately 25-35 leaves total creating a full, abundant look

TEXT LAYOUT (below the tree):
Line 1: "Lesa Mulligan, MD" - elegant handwritten/script font, dusty rose pink color (#C17B8E)
Line 2: "Ob-Gyn" - stylized script font, mauve/purple color (#8B5A8C)
Line 3: "TAKING CARE OF GENERATIONS" - small caps, clean sans-serif, spaced out, gray (#666666)

STYLE:
- Feminine but professional
- Soft, welcoming, nurturing feel
- Medical/healthcare appropriate
- Modern yet timeless
- Clean with adequate white space

COLORS:
- Leaves: Gradient of pinks (#F5D0DC light, #E8A0B5 medium) and purples (#D4B8D5 light, #9B7BB8 medium)
- Figure/trunk: Warm tan/beige (#C4A882)
- Text: Dusty rose and mauve tones
- Background: Transparent

OUTPUT:
- PNG format with transparent background
- High resolution, clean edges
```

## Reference Description of Original Logo

The original logo (for reference only - we're creating new):
- Tree made of pink and purple teardrop-shaped leaves (about 30 leaves)
- Tan/beige abstract human figure as the trunk
- Figure's arms reach up and become branches holding the leaves
- Leaves arranged in a dome/umbrella shape above the figure
- Previously had two names side by side - now only need "Lesa Mulligan, MD"
- "Ob-Gyn" in stylized pink script below
- "TAKING CARE OF GENERATIONS" in small caps at bottom
