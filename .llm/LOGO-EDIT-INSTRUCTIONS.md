- The tree design with pink and purple leaves
- The tan/beige human figure in the center
- "Lesa Mulligan, MD" text (move to center below the figure)
- "Ob-Gyn" text
- "TAKING CARE OF GENERATIONS" tagline

LAYOUT AFTER EDIT:
- Tree with leaves at top
- Figure in center
- "Lesa Mulligan, MD" centered below the figure
- "Ob-Gyn" below that
- "TAKING CARE OF GENERATIONS" at bottom

Keep the same pink (#E8A0B5), purple (#9B7BB8), and tan (#C4A882) color scheme.
